# Fractals - personal project of Francis Vilums

Programs created for the 2020 personal project at Rīga State 2nd Gymnasium by Francis Viļums

Programs were created after thorough research and selection of fractals as part of the personal project

- [The Binary Tree fractal](Fractals/binary-tree.py) - A fractal that is made up of a branch that splits into two branches, each of which splits into two branches and so on. Named so because it looks like a tree
- [The Three Branched Tree fractal](Fractals/three-branched-tree.py) - a fractal similar to the Binary Tree fractal, but with three branches each iteration, rather than two
- [The Barnsley Fern](Fractals/fern.py) - a fractal similar to the Three Branched Tree fractal, but with changes in branch lengths and angles to make it look like a fern rather than a tree
- [An unnamed fractal based on the letter "F"](Fractals/f-fractal.py) - a fractal shaped like an "F", but with each "branch" of the "F" also being another "F"
- [The Vicsek fractal](Fractals/vicsek.py) - a fractal shaped like a cross that is made out of five smaller crosses, which is made out of five smaller crosses and so on
- [The Sierpiński Carpet](Fractals/sierpinski-carpet.py) - a fractal made up of a square that is split into nine smaller squares and has the center square removed, each of the remaining smaller squares also having the same process done to them
- [The Sierpiński Triangle](Fractals/sierpinski-triangle.py) - a fractal made up of a triangle that is split into four smaller triangles and has the center triangle removed, each of the remaining smaller triangles also having the same process done to them

Programs are programmed in Python and require the graphics library Pyglet to run
